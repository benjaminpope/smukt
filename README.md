Now that TESS has observed the Kepler fields in Sectors 14 and 15, we have the opportunity to compare both instruments' observations of the same stars!

The trouble is - TESS is designed to look at stars five mags or so brighter than Kepler. It is hard to compare like-for-like, looking at stars in TESS' magnitude range of peak sensitivity.

Enter the [Kepler Smear Campaign](https://github.com/benjaminpope/smearcampaign/) crossmatch! These bright stars (around Kp = 5 to 9) are right in the sweet spot for TESS. With coverage across the full Kepler mission they have much better time baselines for transits or stellar oscillations than TESS, and can be used to enhance TESS detections of interesting phenomena.

Meanwhile, because they were produced from a 1D projection of the Kepler field, there were significant problems with contamination for some of the stars: TESS can resolve these targets separately from their contaminants and do away with this problem.

*smukt!*
